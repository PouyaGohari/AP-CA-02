# My Repository
In this repo which is my third project in AP's course in UOT [University Of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en) we learn how to write functions recursively.
## Installations 
You should run this in c++ IDE or in Linux OS.
## Usage
In order to run the code in linux's terminal you should run this command:

g++ -std=c++11 code_name.cpp -o output_name.out 

Also for give it input and output you must run this command:

./output_name.out input_directory.txt ouput_directory.txt
## Problems
In the Question1 2 files has differents outputs from wanted but it gives us segmentation eror which I think it might be from lack of memory.

For the Question2 in pdf (https://github.com/PouyaGohari/AP-CA-02/blob/main/APF00-A2-Description.pdf) file max limit for S.length is 30 but in the tests is 100 so we changed it to 100.
